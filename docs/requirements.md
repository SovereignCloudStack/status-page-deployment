# Requirements

The requirements are specific for the relevant environment.

In general a running k8s cluster is needed, as well as tooling to interface with the given cluster, e.g. `kubectl`.

For a local development cluster `KinD`, `minikube` or similar can be used. `KinD` is the currently tested method.

For a single machine deployment `k3s` is the currently tested method.

A production deployment needs a production ready k8s cluster, in which ever form is deemed practical.

Please refer to the used method of deployment for more specific information about setup and requirements.
